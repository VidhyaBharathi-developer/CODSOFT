    <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
    <p>Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, was born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, India2. He came from a wealthy and politically influential family. His father, Motilal Nehru, was a prominent lawyer and nationalist leader, while his mother, Swarup Rani Nehru, played a significant role in his upbringing.
        Nehru received a Western-style education. He was homeschooled in India by English tutors before continuing his studies at Harrow School in London and Trinity College, Cambridge2. Later, he trained in law at the Inner Temple, becoming a barrister before returning to India. His exposure to British education and culture shaped his intellectual outlook, but he soon became deeply involved in India's struggle for independence.
        His early political career saw him joining the Indian National Congress, where he emerged as a progressive leader advocating for secularism, democracy, and modernization. His association with Mahatma Gandhi helped him rise within the party, eventually leading to his pivotal role in India's independence movement.</p>
